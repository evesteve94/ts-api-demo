Benefits of the File Structure
This file structure is designed to make your code organized, maintainable, and scalable. By separating different parts of your application, each part can focus on one specific job, making the code easier to understand, debug, and expand. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each module does:

1. Controllers
   What It Does: Controllers handle the logic of incoming HTTP requests. They decide what should happen when a user visits a specific URL in your app.
   Example: If someone visits /posts/1, the controller decides to fetch the post with ID 1 and send it back to the user.
   Benefit: Keeps your routing clean and focuses on handling HTTP requests.

2. Handlers
   What It Does: Handlers do the heavy lifting with the database. They perform operations like fetching, inserting, updating, or deleting data.
   Example: When the controller says, "Fetch the post with ID 1," the handler knows how to do that by querying the database.
   Benefit: Centralizes all database interactions in one place, making it easier to manage and update.

3. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
   What It Does: DTOs define the shape of the data your app works with. They are like blueprints that show what properties an object should have.
   Example: A PostDTO might include fields like title, content, malmobo_id, etc.
   Benefit: Ensures that data being passed around in your app is consistent and correctly structured.

4. Validation
   What It Does: Validation ensures that the data coming into your app is correct before it's processed. This can prevent bad data from being saved to the database.
   Example: If a user tries to create a post without a title, the validation will catch that and send an error back to the user.
   Benefit: Protects your app from bad data and reduces bugs by catching errors early.

5. Routers
   What It Does: Routers define the different routes (URLs) that users can access in your app and connect those routes to the appropriate controller functions.
   Example: The /posts route might be handled by the postsRouter, which knows which controller function to call for each HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
   Benefit: Keeps your routes organized and connects them to the right logic.

Summary
Controllers: Handle requests.
Handlers: Interact with the database.
DTOs: Define data structure.
Validation: Ensure data correctness.
Routers: Organize routes.
By using this structure, your app's code is more organized, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale as your project grows. Each piece of the application has a clear responsibility, reducing complexity and making it easier to manage.
